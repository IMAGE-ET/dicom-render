Simple render for Dicom files. 

This is only one thing, that helped our project to get compatibility with .dic files that we had. 
Render based on this: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10908/DICOM-parser-based-on-DICOM-server-from-dicomapi 
I just removed all MFC junk and wrote wrapper in C#.

Also, I cannot get how to build dcmrender.dll using MSVC 2008 or 2010. So if somebody has an idea, please let me know.
